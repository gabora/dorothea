Description: This package contains human and mouse TF regulons.
    The human regulons were curated and collected from different types of 
    evidence such as literature curated resources, ChIP-seq peaks, TF binding 
    site motifs and interactions inferred directly from gene expression. The 
    mouse regulons were constructed by mapping the human gene symbols to their 
    orthologs in mice. Those regulons can be coupled with any statistical method
    that aims to analyse gene sets to infer TF activity from gene expression 
    data. Preferably the statistical method viper is used.
